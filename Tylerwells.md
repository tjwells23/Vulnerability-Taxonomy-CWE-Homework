## CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials

The code vulnerability at hand falls under Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) 798, specifically addressing the "Use of Hard-coded Credentials." In the Inbound scenario, a critical flaw is present as the code embeds a default administration account with an unchangeable password. This design flaw allows unauthorized access by anyone familiar with the hard-coded password, posing a substantial security risk. The uniformity of this password across installations increases the vulnerability to widespread attacks, including worms targeting the shared credential.

Similarly, in the Outbound context, the code vulnerability aligns with CWE 798, as it involves insecurely hard-coding credentials for connecting to a back-end service. This practice exposes a significant risk, as users may potentially extract the password, jeopardizing the overall system security. The simplicity of extracting a password from the binary intensifies the severity of this vulnerability.

To address these vulnerabilities, the code should adopt secure authentication practices. In the Inbound scenario, rather than hard-coding a default administration account with a fixed password, the system should implement dynamic, user-specific credentials that administrators can securely manage and change. Furthermore, the password storage mechanism should adhere to industry best practices, including the use of secure hashing algorithms. In the Outbound scenario, the code should steer clear of hard-coding credentials into the front-end product. Instead, it should implement secure methods such as OAuth or token-based authentication to prevent the easy extraction of sensitive information from the binary. By incorporating these secure coding practices, the code can significantly mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches associated with hard-coded credentials.

I have personal experience with this working in IT because our software/machines require token-based authentication aka DUO mobile in order to log in to their own machines, as well as requirement of admin approval to install any software. This is to prevent any unauthorized access to the machines and to prevent any data breaches. Passwords are securely stored in database that are only accessed through admin rights.
